# Phisics-Constrained-ML in flow prediction

Enforcing incompressibility and non-dimensionalization on neural networks for fast and accurate flow predictions.

## Get environment working

The main dependency is `torch`.
To automatically create a `conda` environment with a working setup run:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
This will create a `conda` environment named `ml` (first line in `environment.yml`) containing all the required packages.
